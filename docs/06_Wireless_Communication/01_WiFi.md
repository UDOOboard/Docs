## Ralink/Mediatek RT5370

UDOO QUAD/DUAL uses the Ralink/Mediatek RT5370 to provide the Wi-Fi connectivity. Ralink/MediaTek RT5370 is a system on a chip (SOC) with a USB 2.0 interface for 802.11n Wi-Fi at data rates up to 150Mbit/s. RT5370 features integrated 802.11n baseband and MAC (media access control), power amplifier and low-noise amplifier, along with both transmit-receive and antenna diversity switches. Together with an optimised RF architecture and baseband algorithms, RT5370 gives superb performance and reliable throughput with low power consumption.

## Connecting to Wi-Fi networks

You can connect to wireless networks by:
 * using the network utility in the UDOObuntu desktop environment (in the bottom-right corner).
 * using the [Web Control Panel](!Basic_Setup/Web_Control_Panel), in *Configuration*/*Network settings*;

## Improve Wi-Fi signal performances

UDOO's Wi-Fi modules comes with an on-board PCB antenna. To improve the Wi-Fi signal performances you can follow this tutorial to use an external antenna via soldered RF cable: [Mod your UDOO to Improve Wi-Fi Performances](http://www.udoo.org/tutorial/mod-udoo-improve-wi-fi-performances/).
