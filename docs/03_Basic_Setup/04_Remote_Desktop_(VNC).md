What you should do now is downloading a suitable VNC client, like [VNC Viewer](https://www.realvnc.com/download/viewer/)
So, once downloaded just execute the program and install it.
Then, open the program: a window will pop up.

Assuming your host computer is connected to the same network of UDOO QUAD/DUAL, type the [UDOO's IP Address](../Basic_Setup/Find_IP_Address.html). in the VNC Server adddress, then press "Connect".

Then type your password (default password is *udooer*) and a new window will pop up in your desktop, that is the desktop of your UDOO QUAD/DUAL!
